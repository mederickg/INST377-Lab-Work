  <p>The images above are examples of 4 types of image files.<br/>
    First is a GIF which is a file used for simple image animation.<br/>
    Second is a JPG which is best used for pictures with many different colors.<br/>
    Third is a PNG which allows for transparent and semi-transparent pixels.<br/>
    Lastly is a SVG which uses vectors and not pixels to create images, these files can be
    scaled as much as possible.
