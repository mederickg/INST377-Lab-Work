Replace this with your complete HTML from Lab 1

Hook it up to CSS by including style.css in the <head> tag

Then add CSS class names to your HTML to make it look like the lab pictures.
For example: <div class="selector">

You should not need to edit the CSS to do this, only the HTML.

Don't forget to add an actual set of image descriptions to your image carousel.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>
  <title>Lab 1</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class="topbar">Médérick's Labs For INST377</h1>

  <p>The images above are examples of 4 types of image files.<br/>
    First is a GIF which is a file used for simple image animation.<br/>
    Second is a JPG which is best used for pictures with many different colors.<br/>
    Third is a PNG which allows for transparent and semi-transparent pixels.<br/>
    Lastly is a SVG which uses vectors and not pixels to create images, these files can be
    scaled as much as possible.
